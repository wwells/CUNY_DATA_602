"""HW10 for CUNY 602:  Advanced Programming Techniques, Spring 2017

__author__= 'Walt Wells'

In this homework we will explore the matplotlib library and its features by 
plotting the results of previous assignments.  

1) Express the cars.data.csv data as a series of bar graphs.  The x-axis represents 
a feature and the y-axis is the frequency in the sample.  Do this with the 'buying', 
'maint', 'safety', and 'doors' fields with one plot for each for a total of four.  
Make each graph a subplot of a single output.  

2) Plot your results from the linear regression in homework 5 and 7 (for any of the 
provided data sets).  The plot should include.  1) a scatter of the points in the 
.csv file 2) a line showing the regression line (either from the calculation in 
homework 5 or line-fitting from homework 7).  3) something on the plot that specifies 
the equation for the regression line.  

3) Create an overlay of the center points found in objects.png from homework 8.  The 
image should be in the background and the object centers can be small circles or 
points at or around the center points.

4) Plot a line graph that shows the hour by hour change in number of server requests 
from the HTTP in homework 9.  The x-axis is the discrete hour intervals (e.g. 13:00 â€“ 
14:00) and the y-axis is the number of requests.
